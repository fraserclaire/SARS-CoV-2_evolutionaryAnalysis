Table. Estimates of Average Evolutionary Divergence over Sequence Pairs within Groups
The number of base differences per site from averaging over all sequence pairs within each group are shown. Standard error estimate(s) are shown above the diagonal. This analysis involved 689 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 29903 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11 [1]
